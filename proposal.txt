   3. POTENTIALLY: Integrating jQuery to create collapsing views for audition times?





1. POTENTIAL CHALLENGES:

   1.  WAITLIST

      1. Actors who sign up after auditions are full get put on a waitlist

         1. Another Waitlist Model, Controller, Routes

   1. GOOGLE MAPS API INTEGRATION-CHECK-IN: 

      1. Add Google Maps API… If an actor given a particular audition slot  doesn’t “check in” 1 hr in advance, they lose their spot, and it is given to the first person on the waitlist

         1. Create Associations with Actors and Waitlist

         2. Create a Check-in system with Google Maps API...

1. REACH GOALS: 

1. CREDIT CARD FEE: If you don’t physically check-in on time, you lose your spot and are charged $20. 

2. TEXT-MESSAGING: If auditions are running behind, the casting director can push back all audition times by X minutes and inform all actors by text message





TIMELINE ESTIMATES (NOT INCLUDING REACH GOALS): 





BACKEND

ACTOR SECTION: 1-2 hours

CASTING DIRECTOR SECTION: 1-2 Hours

AUDITION SECTION: 1-2 hours





FRONT END

        PAGE VIEWS: 3-4 hours





API INTEGRATION: 

        This will probably take the longest… 5-6 hours?





JQUERY SECTION

        (If we can figure out how to sync w/ Rails…) 2 hours
